            subtitle : "Intership at EVS Toulouse SAS - Toulouse - June to Septembre 2016", 
            description : "From June to September 2016, I did an intership at EVS Toulouse SAS. Born as Opencube in 2003, the company was bought by the group EVS, whom the headquarters are located in Li√®ge, Belgium. During this internship, I implemented a software component which aims to send video over IP for TV broadcast production servers, according to RFC4175. I had to follow the evolution of the standard (which is constantly evolving since it is very new) and adapt my implemented progressively. I coded it in C++ using Qt Creator on a Linux virtual machine running on Windows. To test it, it used several APIs developped by EVS such as video encoders, video generators, etc. I used SSH protocol to run my program on a Linux server because it needed many other components that could not be installed in my machine. The component I developped was succesfully tested during a workshop in Houston, Texas, by a colleague. After I finished this component, I proceeded to several modifications on other components already developped to follow the evolution of standards (RFC, AES, SMPTE). Please find in annex a poster I made about this internship."

    conclusion: `
This intershiph was a great experience for many reasons: I thought the subject was very interesting, and I particularly appreciated implementing
a component from scratch on the basis of an RFC. I know that it is the media aspect of the project that made it so interesting. It was an 
good challenge because I had never coded in C++, and this project made me learn and practice this language. It also made me becoming 
familiar with life in a company and industrial project management. The team I worked with used JIRA as an Agile project management software and 
it has been a good initiation to this method of project management. I also became more comfortable with Git, using GitKraken user interface.
