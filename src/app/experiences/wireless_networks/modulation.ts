# Modulation for Communications
## Study at University of Indonesia - Jakarta - 2015
During my semester abroad, I studied telecommunications at University of Indonesia (Jakarta), and studied more precisely the different technics of signal modulation : frequency, amplitude, and phase. I made a presentations to the class with some classmates about phase modulation and phase shift keying modulation.

# AM Radio Receptor
## Project at INSA - Toulouse - 2014-2015
I wrote this document with a classmate after a practical class about radio telecommunications. We gave it the form of a tutorial that teaches how to conveive and implement an AM radio receiver.
